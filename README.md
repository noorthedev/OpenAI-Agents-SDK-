# Math Agent 🧮

This is a simple example project demonstrating the use of the OpenAI Agents SDK.
It creates a math helper agent that can add and multiply numbers using custom function tools.

# 📂 Project Structure
math_agent.py   # Main file containing the agent and tools
README.md       # Documentation file

# ⚙️ Requirements

Python 3.10+

Install the OpenAI Agents SDK (supports function tools and agents):

pip install openai

▶️ How to Run

Run the agen:

python math_agent.py

# 💡 Example Output
Agent Response: The result of adding 15 and 30 is 45.

# 📖 How It Works

Define tools → add_numbers and multiply_numbers functions decorated with @function_tool.

Create agent → math_agent with instructions and tools.

Run agent → Using Runner.run_sync, the agent interprets input and calls the right tool.

✅ This project shows how to create function-calling AI agents with OpenAI’s SDK.
Perfect starting point for building smarter assistants that can use custom logic! 🚀
